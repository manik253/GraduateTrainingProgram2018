2.Find all years that have a movie that received a rating of 4 or 5, and sort them in increasing order?

5.Write a query to return the ratings data in a more readable format: reviewer name, movie title, stars, and ratingDate. Also, sort the data, first by reviewer name, then by movie title, and lastly by number of stars?

sqlite> select r.name,m.title,rt.stars,rt.ratingdate from rating rt
   ...> join reviewer r on r.rid=rt.rid
   ...> join movie m on m.mid=rt.mid

6.For all cases where the same reviewer rated the same movie twice and gave it a higher rating the second time, return the reviewer's name and the title of the movie?





7.For each movie that has at least one rating, find the highest number of 
stars that movie received. Return the movie title and number of stars. 
Sort by movie title?

SELECT m.title, max( rt.stars )  AS highest_star, count( rt.mid )  AS nuberofratings
FROM movie m
JOIN rating rt ON rt.mid = m.mid
GROUP  BY rt.mid
ORDER  BY m.title ASC

8.For each movie, return the title and the 'rating spread', that is, the 
difference between highest and lowest ratings given to that movie. Sort 
by rating spread from highest to lowest, then by movie title?

SELECT m.title, (max( rt.stars )  - min( rt.stars ) 
) AS ratingSpread
FROM movie m
JOIN rating rt ON rt.mid = m.mid
GROUP  BY rt.mid
ORDER  BY ratingSpread DESC , m.title ASC

9.Find the difference between the average rating of movies released before
 1980 and the average rating of movies released after 1980. (Make sure 
to calculate the average rating for each movie, then the average of 
those averages for movies before 1980 and movies after. Don't just 
calculate the overall average rating before and after 1980.)?




10.Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind?

SELECT  DISTINCT (r.name
)
FROM reviewer r
JOIN rating rt ON rt.rid = r.rid
JOIN movie m ON rt.mid = m.mid
WHERE rt.mid
IN (
SELECT mid
FROM movie
WHERE title =  'Gone with the Wind'
);

11.For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the 
movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars?

SELECT r.name, m.title, rt.stars
FROM reviewer r
JOIN rating rt ON rt.rid = r.rid
JOIN movie m ON m.mid = rt.mid
AND r.name = m.director

12.Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list, 
alphabetized. (Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word 
in the title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or 
removing "The".)?

SELECT r.name, m.title
FROM movie m
JOIN rating rt ON rt.mid = m.mid
JOIN reviewer r ON rt.rid = r.rid
ORDER  BY r.name ASC , m.title ASC
