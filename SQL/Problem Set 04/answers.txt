3.For every pair of students who both like each other, return the name and grade of both students. Include each pair only once, with the two names in alphabetical order.

sqlite> select h1.name,h1.grade,h2.name,h2.grade from highschooler h1
   ...> join likes l1 on l1.id1=h1.id
   ...> join highschooler h2 on l1.id2=h2.id
   ...> join likes l2 on l1.id1=l2.id2 and l1.id2=l2.id1 and l1.id1>l1.id2 order by h1.name,h2.name;
   
   4.Find all students who do not appear in the Likes table (as a student who likes or is liked) and return their names and grades. Sort by grade, then by name within each grade.
   
 sqlite> select  name,grade from highschooler where id not in ( select id1 from likes union select id2 from likes);

6.Find names and grades of students who only have friends in the same grade. Return the result sorted by grade, then by name within each grade. 
sqlite>  select h1.name,h1.grade,h2.name,h2.grade from highschooler h1
   ...>    join friend f on h1.id=f.id1
   ...>    join highschooler h2 on h2.id=f.id2 where h1.grade=h2.grade and h1.name < h2.name;
